In the back of your mind, you are reminded of your sad existence living on an island alone, having to perform the same monotonous tasks day in and day out. But today, you have a feeling that something is about to change. While you are mining deep down in the dark, you feel your pickaxes hit against something hard, harder than any rock you’ve ever encountered. You hold your torch up to it and reveal a drawing, apparently drawn by a ... crude artist. An etching of a square made of dirt with a swirl design on the interior of it as well as a diamond floating above depicts a portal-like entity. Finally, something interesting, you think to yourself. You get curious and decide to recreate the image. The materials are easy to get, as you have plenty of them to spare. You drop the diamond in, and a portal activates. You gather some of your best armor, tools, and weapons and cautiously step in, anxious to see what’s on the other side. The light around you turns to pitch black darkness. Slowly, it subsides, and a world of fantasy surrounds you. Welcome to the Twilight Forest. ",

You collect some of the roots in your inventory. You remember that you saw a recipe for a new material that required these ingredients. You craft some of the new material and place it in a furnace. You wait for a few seconds and see the furnace produce some shiny metal pieces. You are excited to see what you can make with them.

You hit the ground with a thud and a pain shoots through your back. You get up as quickly as possible to see the Naga blitz at you and you quickly take your sword and slice at it. It slithers off again, but slower this time. It seems to be scared of you now, so you run at it, but it’s still too fast for you. A couple minutes of chasing later, you run out of energy and pillar up and sit down, defeated. The Naga will keep recharging and you will never be able to slay it. Or at least you thought. Suddenly, you think of something. As you study the movements of the Naga, you realize a pattern in its movements. You strategize a method to run in an efficient way, and with newfound energy, you hop down and start. Slash! Slash! Slash!
